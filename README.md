## Description of Our Approach: Design Pool
###Women’s Health Adverse Events Survey Prototype

Once the challenge in the RFQ had been announced, Team NISH, consisting of four key members, met to discuss how we could present the Open FDA data sets provided and the best way to create a prototype that would not only demonstrate our understanding of information design, but of the entire user/human centered design and agile development process.
Sara Mastro, the Senior Director of Experience Design for Mediabarn was assigned as the product manager for this prototype.  Once her role was established, she assigned a user researcher, visual designer, front end web developer and content writer/designer/strategist, all the roles needed for this assignment.

To kick off the project, the team first needed to decide on the WHAT. What opportunities are there to leverage this open data that could be useful and effective?  The team brainstormed several concepts and agreed upon creating a prototype for an online public survey. This survey would be used to help the FDA gather more information on the current drug adverse events data than they already have, and to help with safety and the public’s health moving forward.

Once we identified our product concept, we needed to decide on the WHO. Who would this survey be for? Who is the main target audience?  Women 55-90 years old met the data guidelines and would benefit from any findings and improvements the FDA could make on medications, labeling, guidelines moving forward. The secondary audience; physicians, would also be able to access all the data derived from the survey responses.  Although this user group flow will not be fully vetted in the prototype, we provided a “For Physicians” link on the home page that would eventually lead to a section that would display all results data in easy to view chunks for physicians/medical professionals to review.

Once a concept was thought through, we then moved to the HOW.  How would we illustrate our ideas?  We would use our process to create quick concepts we could swiftly iterate on. We wanted to be able to show data that was easy to read, and would help not only the general consumer understand the landscape of drug adverse events, but help the FDA in the long term with this survey data that we were going to collect.

####Wireframing
We sketched out several wireframe concepts, meeting frequently to review, discuss and iterate.  Once we had a wireframe (UI) we liked, we conducted hallway usability testing with a few users in our target demographic to make sure the content and structure was intuitive. From those conversations we made improvements, and reviewed a final wireframe set internally.

####Visual Design
Designing from the agreed upon wireframes was the next step, and once we had a main page design, we met again as a group to review, discuss, revise. This led to several changes – some aesthetic, some structural.

####Front-end Development
Once the design was approved by the team, our front end developer created a prototype using five modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, and Google charts.  To ensure our responsive designs would properly render on different mobile devices we utilized the Bootstrap responsive framework.  All of the technologies used are openly licensed and free of charge. We installed the prototype on our development server and also included steps on how to install on a different machine.

####User Testing and Research
The prototype was tested via brief usability tests with more participants within the target audience. Testing was conducted on an Axure click through prototype.  It was during these tests we collected valuable feedback that changed the structure of the landing page and the way we would display the data.  We also conducted an expert content review and made copy edits to help finalize the prototype.

Finally, a style guide was created so that this prototype could easily be expanded upon and fully built out by the development team.

####Review Notes
This prototype represents just a segment of what we would envision the full online survey to be.  This shows two questions as a sample, however, the complete product would be a total of 5 questions, with data corresponding to each answer.  
In this prototype, not all links are functional, but you may click through the survey questions and answer successfully.  The footer links, About, FAQ, For Physicians and Print are not functional at this time.
