##CRITERIA H:
Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype

##EVIDENCE:

####Iterative Design Approach

Team NISH employed an iterative approach in the design and development of our prototype for this exercise.  Following is a brief listing of specific examples of input that implemented as a direct result of user feedback obtained during the process.

####Examples of Specific Feedback That Informed Design

#####Hallway usability testing:

 Added ability to send results to email or print out on the Thank You page.
 Made copy revisions to make the survey questions more clear.  

#####Axure prototype usability testing:

 Addressed the “AE” logo.  Revised branding to spell-out “Adverse Events” in order to make it more understandable to users. 
 Updated chart labeling and made the data more clear by incorporating real data and Google chart interactions. 
 Added add brief descriptions for the adverse events via rollover as not everyone will understand what some of these side        effects are, i.e., Dyspnea
 Added an email capture field on the Thank You screen.
