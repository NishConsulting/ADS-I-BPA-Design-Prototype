##CRITERIA H:
Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype

##EVIDENCE:

####Iterative Design Approach

Team NISH employed an iterative approach in the design and development of our prototype for this exercise.  See [feedback](https://github.com/NishConsulting/ADS-I-BPA-Design-Prototype/blob/master/Feedback/UI%20changes.md). Following is a brief listing of specific examples of input that implemented as a direct result of user feedback obtained during the process.

####Examples of Specific Feedback That Informed Design

#####Hallway usability testing:

- Added ability to send results to email or print out on the Thank You page.
- Made copy revisions to make the survey questions more clear.  

#####Axure prototype usability testing:

- Addressed the “AE” logo.  Revised branding to spell-out “Adverse Events” in order to make it more understandable to users. 
- Updated chart labeling and made the data more clear by incorporating real data and Google chart interactions. 
- Added add brief descriptions for the adverse events via rollover as not everyone will understand what some of these side        effects are, i.e., Dyspnea
- Added an email capture field on the Thank You screen.
