# CRITERIA 1: Assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted

EVIDENCE: For Team NISH, authority, responsibility, and accountability for project quality is somewhat distributed. We assigned a product manager for Design prototype. The primary responsibility of the product manager was to ensure the project health.

Throughout the development of the Design prototype, our Product Manager ensured that:

- everyone is heard

- there are few surprises - roadblocks are communicated as early as possible

This means ensuring that the clients needs are being addressed in the most efficient manner.
