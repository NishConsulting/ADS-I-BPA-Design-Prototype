## CRITERIA 1: 
Assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted

##EVIDENCE: 
For Team NISH, authority, responsibility, and accountability for project quality was the purview of the project manager.

We assigned a product manager for NISH Design prototype. The primary responsibility of the product manager was NISH Design prototype health. Throughout the design of NISH prototype, our product manager ensured that everyone was heard and all roadblocks were communicated as early as possible.

This means ensuring that the clients needs are being addressed in the most efficient manner.
