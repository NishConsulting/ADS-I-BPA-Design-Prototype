## CRITERIA D:
Used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools

## EVIDENCE

### Personas and Use Cases
Following are brief user personas and use cases for this prototype design exercise.

### USER PERSONAS
Two user personas were involved in this exercise:

####1.  Consumer (between 55-90 years of age.)
Stacy, an experienced school teacher who is 57 and lives with her husband of 25 years. She has 3 kids and 1 grandchild.
Stacy has battled with arthritis, some migraines and sciatica.  She has taken various medications for these conditions for the past 10 years.

####2.  Physician
Dr. Shilling has been a general practitioner in Phoenix, Arizona for 27 years. He regularly prescribes a wide range of medications to his 250+ patients, a little over half of which are women.

## USE CASES

####1.  Consumer
Stacy lands on survey home page from either a link on the FDA site or elsewhere. She starts the survey from the “For Consumers” block on the home page. She answers each question and completes the survey. She emails her survey results to herself and shares with her physician on her next appt.

####2.  Physician
The physician use case to be clarified in a future iteration with the benefit of more user research and testing.  Early concepts include providing physicians the ability to see the data on adverse events while prescribed drug to a patient.  Physicians could provide that information to patients while prescribing the drug so patient is aware of such adverse events/side effects.  This use case would not be in survey form, but rather serve as a tool that displays survey results and other data from the FDA’s open API.  Physicians may also decide not to prescribe certain drug to certain patients based on their potential adverse events.
