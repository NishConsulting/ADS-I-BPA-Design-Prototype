##CRITERIA 7:
Performed usability tests with people

###Usability Testing on Axure Prototype

Following are the questions we asked test participants during usability testing as well as their responses.  These test sessions were conducted on a clickable prototype we built in Axure.  There were conducted after the initial visual designs were applied to the wireframes and performed concurrently while the first iteration of the front-end was being built.

###TEST QUESTIONS

1) Do you know what this site would be for?
2) What do you think of this layout?
3) Is there anything you find confusing?
4) Is there any content you might add?

###RESPONSES

####Name:  Carol
Demo:  Female, age 41, works at IBM

Feedback:
- The woman in picture on the home page looks a little sickly
- Should we be asking the frequency that the woman is taking the medication?
- Is 30 days long enough?
- On survey results page with data - we need to tie the text in with the percentages on the chart, so people don't have to match up.

####Name:  Marianne
Demo:  Female, age 55, works for Olmstead County

Notes:   Marianne’s occupation is data visualization, so the she provided some interesting comments.
Feedback:
- Design is good, clean
- What is AE? I thought it was the association sponsoring this site.  Consumers won't know what AE is.      
- On the adverse effects, consumers won’t know what some of these are - What is Dypsnea?      
- Page with results - Never make the consumer work too hard to correlate the visual with the remaining data.  Meaning, the donut graph has percentages and to the right are the correlating statements.  You should, 1, add the percentage to the statement, and 2, IN the donut graph, at least add to the percentages the label, so "45% Fatigue".

####Name:  Colleen
Demo:  Female, age 45-50

Feedback:
- Looks like you can get specific info on women's health.  Look up info.
- Not clear what AE is.  Not sure who's running this and what their credentials are.     
- Probably FDA but not sure.
- Results page:  Hard to tell which number goes with which % on the graph
- Good layout overall.  Not too clogged.
- Thank you page:  Is there a sign in?  Was there a place to put the email address?  
- Not sure what to click so I'd just go check my email.
- I don't want to sign-in first.  Want to figure out if it will be helpful to me first.
