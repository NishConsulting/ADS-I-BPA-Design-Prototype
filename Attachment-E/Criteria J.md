### CRITERIA J:

Provided sufficient documentation to install and run the prototype on another machine.

### EVIDENCE:

Following are the steps necessary to install and run our prototype on a different machine.  Please note our prototype build involved static HTML/CSS/js technologies and no PHP or other server side applications.  As such, these steps are pretty straightforward.  

1. Create a new directory on the machine on which you want the prototype to reside.
2. Download the complete prototype build files from this GitHub repostitory location.
3. Place all subfolders and their respective files within your created directory (HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, media assets, etc.). 
4. Click on the “index.html” file located at the root directory level. Note: this should launch the prototype within your default browser.
